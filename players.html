                    <p class="bioparagraph">Born in Rosario, Argentina on June 24, 1987, Lionel Messi 
                        grew up very poor and was suffering from a hormone deficieny which limited his 
                        growth. His parents decided to pay for nightly growth-hormone injections, 
                        but it soon became impossible for the financially struggling family to keep on 
                        affording the monthly bill. Luckily though, Lionel had a natural talent in soccer. 
                        At the age of only eight years old, he signed his first contract with a local club
                        and 5 years later at the age of thirteen, he had moved to Spain after being 
                        offered to train at the legendary FC Barcelona's youth camp, known as La Masia.
                        Fortunately, the club generously covered all of the expenses for the young star's
                        medical bills and he ended up growing to five foot seven, but still the shortest
                        player on the pitch. Just three years later at the age of sixteen, he made his 
                        official debut for FC Barcelona and was already a starter on the Argentinian 
                        national team, dribbling through legendary defenders like they're practice cones. 
                        The rest is history. Messi went on to win a world record of 7x Ballon d'Ors
                        (4 consecutively), 3x UEFA Best Player in Europe, 22x Top Scorer, 10x Player of
                        the Year, 3x player of the Tournament, 5x Golden Boot winner and led Argentina to
                        winning the Copa América, led FC Barcelona to winning 4 Champions League Titles 
                        and winning the Spanish Title 10 times, the Spanish Cup 7 times and the
                        the Super Cup 8 times. By setting and breaking so many records which he holds 
                        plenty more of, including scoring 91 goals in a calendar year which was more than
                        entire teams scored, Lionel Messi is complete at every aspect of the game and has
                        earned his status as the best player of all time. Nobody will ever be like him.

                 <div class="bioplayersleagues">
                    <p class="bioparagraph">Cristiano Ronaldo was born on February 5, 1985 in Madeira,
                        Portugal. He grew up in a working class neighbourhood and was introduced to soccer
                        through his dad who worked as an equipment manager at a local youth club. 
                        Cristiano had a tough life growing up and had to learn to be independant at a
                        super young age, mainly because of his father who was drunk all day. Even though
                        this was the case, they still maintained a very close bond together and Ronaldo 
                        was heartbroken after his passing, especially that he would never see him become
                        a legend. As a kid, the young prodigy loved soccer so much that he would ignore
                        his school life and miss meals to play the sport. At only 16 years old, Manchester
                        United, an English Football Club with plenty of history, offered more than £12 
                        million to sign the teenager. Six years later, he signed a five year £31 million 
                        contract at the club. By the end of his English career, he led the team to win 3
                        Premier League titles, a Champions League title, 2 Supercup titles and one Ballon
                        d'Or for himself. Cristiano then moved off to Spain on a £84.60 million release,
                        where he won 4 more Ballon d'Or awards during his time in Spain, 3x UEFA Best 
                        Player in Europe, 10x Footballer of the Year, 4 more Champion League titles,
                        2x Spanish Cup and Supercup. When his time at Madrid was finished, he went to 
                        Italy to join the Serie A club Juventus. With the Italian club, they won 8 Serie A
                        titles in a row. At the end of August 2021, Ronaldo returned to where he started
                        his career, Manchester United. This man is definitely the most determined and 
                        hard working athlete of all time. He put in so much work to be where he is 
                        currently at right now. Cristiano takes so much care for himself and he trains for
                        five hours every single day. The level that he is at is certainly very well 
                        deserved and this is why he is one of the greats and a huge inspiration around the 
                        world.

                <div class="bioplayersleagues">
                   <p class="bioparagraph">Diego Maradona was born on October 30, 1960, in Buenos Aires,
                    Argentina. He grew up very poor just like many other soccer players. At the age of 
                    three years old, Diego received a soccer ball as a gift and quickly fell in love with
                    the game. At the age of 10, he was signed to the biggest youth team in Argentina at
                    the time. With his magnificent talent, they went on a 136 game win streak.
                    By the time Maradona turned 16, he made his official professional debut. 
                    The Argentinian was best known for his international career for his country. He led
                    Argentina to winning the 1986 World Cup by netting two goals against England. By the
                    end of his international career, he scored 35 goals in 91 games, which is super
                    impressive for a midfielder, considering it's a supporting position and not a 
                    goalscoring one. Diego Maradona was a brilliant player who represented nothing but
                    high intelligence and skills on the pitch. With amazing ball control, dribbling,
                    playmaking and finishing, he became the greatest player of his generation in no time.
                    Before his birthday, in 1997 he announced his retirement at the age of 37. Very sadly,
                    Diego Maradona passed away two years ago on November 25 at just sixty years old due to 
                    drug abuse. He will forever be a legend.
