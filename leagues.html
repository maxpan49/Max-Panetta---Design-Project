                Tottenham. The top goalscorer in the Premier League was Newcastle's Alan Shearer, with 260
                goals. Manchester United currently hold 13 titles, the most out of all the other English

                Serie A, the oldest of this ranking founded in 1898, is based in Italy and it is second
                in the league rankings. The winner of the twenty clubs is awarded the scudetto. 
                The Italian League is known for using the best tactics and playing intelligently with
                their extremely smart managers. Serie A used to be the league that led the UEFA ranking 
                from 1986-88 and 1990-99 and it's also home to some of the most popular clubs in the
                world, like Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan. It's dominated by these teams, as well as
                Napoli and Roma. Juventus currently holds the most titles in the league, with 36.
                According to statistics, more players have won the Ballon d'Or at Serie A than any other
                league in the world. The top goalscorer is Silvio Piola with 274 goals and other notable
                players include Antonio Di Natale, Diego Maradona, Roberto Baggio, Alessandro Nesta, 
                Javier Zanetti, Fabio Cannavaro, Gianluigi Buffon, Andrea Pirlo, Alessandro Del Piero,
                Francesco Totti and Paolo Maldini.

                Laliga is based in Spain and it was founded in 1929. In its prime, it would definitely be
                the most competitive and the hardest league in the world. Every legend has played in 
                Laliga, mostly for either FC Barcelona or Real Madrid, the biggest rivalry in soccer. 
                Nowadays though, it is ranked third. This is mainly because of all the class players who
                aren't there anymore, such as Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Andres Iniesta, Ronaldinho,
                Xavi, Iker Casillas, Angel Di Maria, Pepe, Sergio Ramos, Luis Suàrez, Neymar Jr,
                Samuel Eto'o, Ronaldo Nazario, Roberto Carlos, Zinedine Zidane and more. Lionel Messi is
                still the top goalscorer with 474 goals, even after his departure. The largest Laliga 
                stadium, Camp Nou, holds up to 105,000 spectators which it always used to fill only a few
                years ago before everybody left. The stadium belongs to FC Barcelona. Even though Laliga
                is ranked third, it will always be the best league with the most history.

                    The Bundesliga is the German league, founded in 1963. The reason it is ranked so low
                    is because Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund are the only actual good clubs in the
                    league. You will often see these two teams winning against everybody else by over four
                    points because of how bad the other teams are. As a result, they use very aggressive
                    tactics. It's just impossible for them to compete against these two dominant clubs. 
                    Bayern is leading in the most championships with 30 titles and the top goalscorer in 
                    the Bundesliga is Gerd Muller with 365 goals. Notable players include Franz
                    Beckenbauer and Manuel Neuer.

                    The league ranked last is Ligue 1, the French league, formed in 1930. It's really a 
                    league with no history at all. There hasn't been any big notable players and Ligue 1
                    doesn't get too many viewers. There are no good teams, except for Paris-Saint-Germain
                    who dominate everybody else. This league is also the most hated beacuse of its toxic
                    fans who cause violence in the stands and on social media, spreading undeserved hate
                    to their players.
