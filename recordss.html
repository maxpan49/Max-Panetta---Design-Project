        it wouldn't make sense to make it colored as the pictures and color wouldn't go together. Instead,
        black goes with anything. I did it like that for my "players" and "leagues" page as well for the
        same reason.-->
        <body class="playersleaguesrecords"> <!--I made the layout this way because I felt like it would
        be more interesting and fun for the user to keep on scrolling to see each record, rather than
        staying at the same place and looking at different boxes. Also, it was a great way to implement
        my pictures, which is why I also used it on my "players" and "leagues" page.-->
