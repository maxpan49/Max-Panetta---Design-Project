            <p> Soccer, also known as football in Europe, is a team sport played with eleven players on
                two different teams.
                The main goal of the game is to work and strategize with your team to to score more goals
                than your opponent.
                It is rare to see a team score more than four goals, the average being anything lower than 
                that.
                Soccer is played on a rectangular pitch that measures 115 yards where there is a goal at
                each end to score the point by kicking the ball into the net before ninety minutes and 
                stoppage time, which varies by the amount of minutes wasted because of stops.
                There is also stoppage time at 45 minutes, which is the half. If the game is still tied 
                but it's important and there needs to be a winner to move on, it goes up to 120 minutes.
                If there is still no goal, the players take penalties 12 yards away from the goal line to
                determine the winner.
                Soccer is played in over 200 countries. According to FIFA, there are over 265 million 
                professional soccer players in the world and around 3.5 billion people watch the sport,
                easily making it the most popular sport in the world.
